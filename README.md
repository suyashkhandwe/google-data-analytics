## Course 1

### Module 1

- Businesses need a way to control all that data so they can use it to improve processes, identify opportunities and trends, launch new products, serve customers, and make thoughtful decisions. 
- The more detailed definition is that data analysis is the collection, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making. 

#### The six steps of the data analysis process

These six steps apply to any data analysis.

- `ask`: business challenge, objective, or question
    - In the `ask phase`, you’ll work to understand the challenge to be solved or the question to be answered.
    - It will likely be assigned to you by stakeholders.
    - As this is the `ask phase`, you’ll ask many questions to help you along the way. 

- `prepare`: data generation, collection, storage, and data management
    - In the `prepare phase` you’ll find and collect the data you'll need to answer your questions.
    - You’ll identify data sources, gather data, and verify that it is accurate and useful for answering your questions. 

- `process`: data cleaning and data integrity
    - The `process phase` is when you will clean and organize your data.
    - Tasks you perform here include removing any inconsistencies, filling in missing values; and, in many cases, changing the data to a format that's easier to work with.
    - Essentially, you’re ensuring the data is ready before you begin analysis.

- `analyze`: data exploration, visualization, and analysis
    - The `analyze phase` is when you do the necessary data analysis to uncover answers and solutions.
    - Depending on the situation and the data, this could involve tasks such as calculating averages or counting items in categories so you can examine trends and patterns.

- `share`: communicating and interpreting results 
    - The `share phase` is when you present your findings to decision-makers through a report, presentation, or data visualization.
    - As part of the `share phase`, you decide which medium you want to use to share your findings and select the data to include.
    - Tools for presenting data visually include charts made in Google Sheets, Tableau, and R. 

- `act`: putting insights to work to solve the problem
    - Last is the `act phase`, in which you and others in the company put the data insights into action.
    - This could mean implementing a new business strategy, making changes to a website, or any other action that solves the initial problem.

##### Types of Data Analytics

- EMC Corporation's (now Dell EMC) `Cyclical` data analytics process has six steps:
    - Discovery
    - Pre-processing data
    - Model planning
    - Model building
    - Communicate results
    - Operationalize
- SAS's `iterative` process
    - Ask
    - Prepare
    - Explore
    - Model
    - Implement
    - Act
    - Evaluate
- A `project-based` data analytics process has five simple steps:
    - Identifying the problem
    - Designing data requirements
    - Pre-processing data
    - Performing data analysis
    - Visualizing data
- `Big data analytics` process
    - Business case evaluation
    - Data identification
    - Data acquisition and filtering
    - Data extraction
    - Data validation and cleaning
    - Data aggregation and representation
    - Data analysis
    - Data visualization
    - Utilization of analysis results

##### The five essential skills of a data analyst

- Curiosity: all about wanting to learn something.
- Understanding context: the condition in which something exists or happens.
- Having a technical mindset: the ability to break things down into smaller steps or pieces and work with them in an orderly and logical way. 
- Data design: how you organize information.
- Data strategy: management of the people, processes, and tools used in data analysis.

##### Analytical Thinking

The five key aspects to analytical thinking arfe 
- visualization: In data analytics, visualization is the graphical representation of information.
- strategy: is key to staying focused and on track. Strategizing helps data analysts see what they want to achieve with the data and how they can get there.
- problem-orientation: approach used to identify, describe, and solve problems.
- correlation: is like a relationship. You can find all kinds of correlations in data.
> [!TIP]
> Correlation does not equal causation. In other words, just because two pieces of data are both trending in the same direction, that doesn't necessarily mean they are all related.
- big-picture and detail-oriented thinking: means being able to see the big picture as well as the details.
