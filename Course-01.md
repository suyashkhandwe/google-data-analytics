# Google Data Analytics - Course 1

This document covers the notes from the Google Data Analytics course - Course 1

## Module 1

- Businesses need a way to control all that data so they can use it to improve processes, identify opportunities and trends, launch new products, serve customers, and make thoughtful decisions.
- The more detailed definition is that data analysis is the collection, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making.

### The six steps/phases of the data analysis process

These six steps apply to any data analysis.

1. `ask`: business challenge, objective, or question

   - In the `ask phase`, you’ll work to understand the challenge to be solved or the question to be answered.
   - It will likely be assigned to you by stakeholders.
   - As this is the `ask phase`, you’ll ask many questions to help you along the way.
1. `prepare`: data generation, collection, storage, and data management

   - In the `prepare phase` you’ll find and collect the data you'll need to answer your questions.
   - You’ll identify data sources, gather data, and verify that it is accurate and useful for answering your questions.
1. `process`: data cleaning and data integrity

   - The `process phase` is when you will clean and organize your data.
   - Tasks you perform here include removing any inconsistencies, filling in missing values; and, in many cases, changing the data to a format that's easier to work with.
   - Essentially, you’re ensuring the data is ready before you begin analysis.
1. `analyze`: data exploration, visualization, and analysis

   - The `analyze phase` is when you do the necessary data analysis to uncover answers and solutions.
   - Depending on the situation and the data, this could involve tasks such as calculating averages or counting items in categories so you can examine trends and patterns.
1. `share`: communicating and interpreting results

   - The `share phase` is when you present your findings to decision-makers through a report, presentation, or data visualization.
   - As part of the `share phase`, you decide which medium you want to use to share your findings and select the data to include.
   - Tools for presenting data visually include charts made in Google Sheets, Tableau, and R.
1. `act`: putting insights to work to solve the problem

   - Last is the `act phase`, in which you and others in the company put the data insights into action.
   - This could mean implementing a new business strategy, making changes to a website, or any other action that solves the initial problem.

### Types of Data Analytics

- EMC Corporation's (now Dell EMC) `Cyclical` data analytics process has six steps:
  - Discovery
  - Pre-processing data
  - Model planning
  - Model building
  - Communicate results
  - Operationalize
- SAS's `iterative` process
  - Ask
  - Prepare
  - Explore
  - Model
  - Implement
  - Act
  - Evaluate
- A `project-based` data analytics process has five simple steps:
  - Identifying the problem
  - Designing data requirements
  - Pre-processing data
  - Performing data analysis
  - Visualizing data
- `Big data analytics` process
  - Business case evaluation
  - Data identification
  - Data acquisition and filtering
  - Data extraction
  - Data validation and cleaning
  - Data aggregation and representation
  - Data analysis
  - Data visualization
  - Utilization of analysis results

### The five essential skills of a data analyst

- `Curiosity`: all about wanting to learn something.
- `Understanding context`: the condition in which something exists or happens.
- Having a `technical mindset`: the ability to break things down into smaller steps or pieces and work with them in an orderly and logical way.
- `Data design`: how you organize information.
- `Data strategy`: management of the people, processes, and tools used in data analysis.

### `Analytical Thinking`

The five key aspects of analytical thinking are:

- `visualization`: In data analytics, visualization is the graphical representation of information.
- `strategy`: is key to staying focused and on track. Strategizing helps data analysts see what they want to achieve with the data and how they can get there.
- `problem-orientation`: approach used to identify, describe, and solve problems.
- `correlation`: is like a relationship. You can find all kinds of correlations in data.

> [!TIP]
> Correlation does not equal causation. In other words, just because two pieces of data are both trending in the same direction, that doesn't necessarily mean they are all related.

- `big-picture and detail-oriented thinking`: means being able to see the big picture as well as the details.

#### Stages of Data Life Cycle

Following are the stages for data life cycle 
1. Plan: Decide what kind of data is needed, how it will be managed, and who will be responsible for it.
    - a business decides what kind of data it needs, how it will be managed throughout its life cycle, who will be responsible for it, and the optimal outcomes
2. Capture: Collect or bring in data from a variety of different sources.
    - data is collected from a variety of different sources and brought into the organization
3. Manage: Care for and maintain the data. This includes determining how and where it is stored and the tools used to do so.
    - how we care for our data, how and where it's stored, the tools used to keep it safe and secure, and the actions taken to make sure that it's maintained properly
4. Analyze: Use the data to solve problems, make decisions, and support business goals.
    - the data is used to solve problems, make great decisions, and support business goals
5. Archive: Keep relevant data stored for long-term and future reference.
    - archiving means storing data in a place where it's still available, but may not be used again
6. Destroy: Remove data from storage and delete any shared copies of the data.

> [!CAUTION]
> As a quick note, when you maintain a database of customer information, ensuring data integrity, credibility, and privacy are all important concerns.
