# Course 2 : Ask Questions to Make Data-Driven Decisions

This document covers the notes from the Google Data Analytics course - Course 2

## Module 1

### Type of problems encountered by Data Analyst

#### Making predictions 

A company that wants to know the best advertising method to bring in new customers is an example of a problem requiring analysts to make predictions. Analysts with data on location, type of media, and number of new customers acquired as a result of past ads can't guarantee future results, but they can help predict the best placement of advertising to reach the target audience.

#### Categorizing things 

An example of a problem requiring analysts to categorize things is a company's goal to improve customer satisfaction. Analysts might classify customer service calls based on certain keywords or scores. This could help identify top-performing customer service representatives or help correlate certain actions taken with higher customer satisfaction scores.

#### Spotting something unusual 

A company that sells smart watches that help people monitor their health would be interested in designing their software to spot something unusual. Analysts who have analyzed aggregated health data can help product developers determine the right algorithms to spot and set off alarms when certain data doesn't trend normally.

#### Identifying themes 

User experience (UX) designers might rely on analysts to analyze user interaction data. Similar to problems that require analysts to categorize things, usability improvement projects might require analysts to identify themes to help prioritize the right product features for improvement. Themes are most often used to help researchers explore certain aspects of data. In a user study, user beliefs, practices, and needs are examples of themes. 

> [!NOTE]
> difference between categorizing things and identifying themes - categorizing things involves assigning items to categories; identifying themes takes those categories a step further by grouping them into broader themes.

#### Discovering connections 

A third-party logistics company working with another company to get shipments delivered to customers on time is a problem requiring analysts to discover connections. By analyzing the wait times at shipping hubs, analysts can determine the appropriate schedule changes to increase the number of on-time deliveries. 

#### Finding patterns

Minimizing downtime caused by machine failure is an example of a problem requiring analysts to find patterns in data. For example, by analyzing maintenance data, they might discover that most failures happen if regular maintenance is delayed by more than a 15-day window. 

### SMART Questions

- `Leading Questions`: Questions that lead the conversation or guide the conversation in a specific direction.
- SMART Questions: **S**pecific, **M**easurable, **A**ction-oriented, **R**elevant, and **T**ime-bound.
  - **Specific** questions are simple, significant and focused on a single topic or a few closely related ideas.
  - **Measurable** questions are questions that can be quantified and accessed.
  - **Action-oriented** questions are questions that are designed to lead to action.
  - **Relevant** matter, are important and have significance to the problem you're trying to solve.
  - **Time-bound** questions specify the time period of interest.
